# Online-reservation-system
The Online Reservation System is a Java console project that allows users to log in, book train tickets, and cancel them using a unique PNR. User data is stored in users.txt, and reservations are saved in reservations.txt. It uses basic file handling, user input, and control flow to simulate a simple reservation system.
